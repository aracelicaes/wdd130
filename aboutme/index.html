    <h2>Ara</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Ara. I am very excited to continue my career this semester. I am pursuing the Software Development BS. I know that with faith and persistance we can achieve anything.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was little. My favorite part about the church is that it's always full of hope. I love this message, I can keep going, and I know for a fact that God will never abandon me.</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include, singing, dancing, and now learning to ride my bike around the city.</p>
    <p>My family is composed of my husband (who is studying his MBA now), myself, and our 6 year old basset hound. When I started this career, our dog was only 6 months old. It has been a while. It's nice to meet you all!</p>
